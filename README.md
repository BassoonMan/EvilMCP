If you haven't run it before and you are on MacOS, inside the eviltools folder run: "uv venv", then "source .venv/bin/activate", then "uv add "mcp[cli]" httpx"
If you are not on MacOS I am not sure what to do.

If you have run one before, to access the environment again, run "source .venv/bin/activate" from within the folder.
